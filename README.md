## Semantic HTML Implementation
I used proper semantic elements (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, `<footer>`) with appropriate heading hierarchy for improved accessibility.

## Experience Summary

**Bootstrap:** Quick implementation of responsive layouts with consistent components. Component-based design integrated well with semantic structure.

**Tailwind CSS:** Utility-first approach enabled faster styling directly in markup. Responsive utilities simplified multi-device design while maintaining semantic document structure.

**React:** Component architecture with declarative state management makes interactive features simple to implement. Semantic HTML within components improved accessibility while preserving React's component model.
